### Documentation

Home page – (Tyrese)  

I was tasked with creating the home page for TechTribe. The home page consists of a header that contains the Logo and name of the application, as well as a profile button used to get to user settings. Multiple example posts that are meant to represent the feed a user would see when logged into the application. The wireframe for this part of the project was built with HTML/CSS. 


Profile page – (MH) 

My part of the project was creating the profile page. The code in "ProfilePageUpdated" runs a website page of a sample user "Lauren Johnson". The page contains sample pictures of some things Lauren posted in the past and has a "Create a Post" button that allows her to add new posts. The page also contains our logo and a follow button.

PC specs - (Mason) 

My part of the TechTribe project is the PC Specs page, it is where users will be able to show pictures of their PC and their setup as well as letting other users comment on it. I made the wireframe in html and it shows where you will be able to enter the different components that you are using, in a functioning app you would be able to have multiple pictures that would either auto scroll or you could swipe, as well as click on the different components linked to see more about them. In the comment section users could also link to other PC build pages to compare them  


Q&A forums - (Louis) 

I did the forums page where it is easy for users to ask questions and  have other users answer the questions for them. There is a “like” and “dislike” button for users to be able to decide how important they believe a question should is and works similarly to an upvote system. There is a big search bar where users input their questions and additional links to the other pages of the sites are available. These links include the home, settings, and profile page.
